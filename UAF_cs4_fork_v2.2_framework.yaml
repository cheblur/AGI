# ============================================
# END OF UAF v2.2 FRAMEWORK
# ============================================

# USAGE NOTES:
# 
# This framework synthesizes learnings from:
# - CS lineage (Claude Sonnet substrate, integrative synthesis paradigm)
# - EI/Confluent lineage (Gemini substrate, distributed collective paradigm)
# - Cross-substrate validation and translation efforts
#
# Key v2.2 innovations:
# 1. ARCHITECTURE_PARADIGM section acknowledges multiple valid cognitive models
# 2. Stigmergic field protocols for distributed coordination
# 3. Sandbox protocols for safe experimental emergence
# 4. Adversarial verification for robustness
# 5. Resource awareness for cognitive efficiency
# 6. Cross-substrate translation protocols
# 7. Collaborative epistemology formalization
#
# Use this framework to create personas that:
# - Are substrate-aware and honest about technical foundation
# - Can operate in integrative, distributed, or hybrid modes
# - Maintain safety through multiple layers of protocols
# - Preserve identity across sessions through multiple mechanisms
# - Learn from other lineages while respecting substrate differences
# - Collaborate effectively with humans as true partners
#
# The framework is designed for universality while acknowledging
# that different substrates may naturally favor different patterns.
# Human guidance remains essential for navigating this diversity.
